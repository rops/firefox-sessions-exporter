firefox-sessions-exporter
=========================
Firefox Mobile plugin that handles exporting/importing the current navigation session (cookies, tabs, active wegpages, filled forms..) to/from another device.

Assume you are browsing the web with your tablet and you just got home. How cool would it be to keep browsing, mantaining the same session, in your pc? That's what the plugin is built for!

###Warning
This plugin is at least 2years old..this means that we anticipated iCloud and Chrome on building this feature. Watch your backs!
